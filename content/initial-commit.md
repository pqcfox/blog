hiya!

i'm kat, and this is my new blog! 

i work in cybersecurity and co-founded the startup [radical semiconductor](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/radical-semiconductor), which focused on designing next-generation processing-in-memory cryptography accelerators. radical was [just acquired](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/25/btq-technologies-completes-acquisition-of-radical-semiconductors-processing-in-memory-technology-portfolio/) (!) which means i finally have time to write a blog.

if you're curious about the stuff i enjoy, here's some other things i've done:

- co-led stanford's inaugural [university rover challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/) team

- wrote avionics code and developed flight sims for [stanford student space initiative](https://www.stanfordssi.org/)'s spin-stabilized [rockoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon) prototype (met my cofounders doing this!)

- implemented drug discovery ML visualization tools (now in production!) for [schr√∂dinger](https://www.schrodinger.com/)

- published [research demonstrating significant shortcomings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02225) in a [stanford vision lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/) visual grounding model

- ran windows/AD offense for stanford's [collegiate penetration testing competition](https://cp.tc/) team, scoring 2nd place worldwide (got to [dump lsass](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/05/detecting-and-preventing-lsass-credential-dumping-attacks/) on the dc--was a super exciting moment)

- wrote an undergrad thesis providing an "operationalized" introduction to [gkm varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GKM_variety)

- frequently led the crypto efforts for [a ctf team](https://ctftime.org/team/128953/) to get several top 10 finishes

- worked on developing novel authentication technology at [intel labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) for a couple summers

heads up that in the above and news articles about me, my deadname ([what's that?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming)) shows up once in a while. i don't particularly care if you see it, but just know i'm the same person.

uh, yeah! working on a fun doom port right now, so hopefully that should be ready for the next blog post :)
